# Week 1 - Machine Learning Techniques

## Supervised Learning 
    * Regression - eg: prediction of house rents and prices
    * Classification - eg: spam classifier 
    * Ranking
note: labels are also available

## Unsupervised Learning 
    * Clustering 
    * Representation learning 

Week 1 is about representation learning

## What is Representation Learning: 
If all the data points lie on the same line, then, the entire data can be represented using a representative vector or point and a set of coefficients. This also helps compress the data. 

If one or more of the points, say x, do not fall on the line, the point can be projected on to the line with an error. 

That way, the point of projection is cW, where c is the coefficient and W is the vector or line on which the point, x is projected. 

Then, the project of x can be calcuated as: $\frac{a}{b}$
