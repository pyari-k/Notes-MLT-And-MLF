### Unitarily Diagonalizable Matrices

A square matrix **A** is **unitarily diagonalizable** if there exists a unitary matrix **U** and a diagonal matrix **D** such that:

$A = UDU^*$ or $U^*AU = D$

where $U^*$ is the conjugate transpose of **U**. The columns of **U** are the orthonormal eigenvectors of **A**, and the diagonal entries of **D** are the corresponding eigenvalues.

### The Spectral Theorem

The **Spectral Theorem** provides the conditions under which a matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary or orthogonal matrix. The key condition is that the matrix must be **normal**.

An **orthogonally diagonalizable** matrix is a real matrix that can be diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix **Q** and a real diagonal matrix **D** such that:

$A = QDQ^T$ or $Q^TAQ = D$Of course! The previous cheatsheet was missing the representation of an orthogonally diagonalizable matrix. Here is the updated cheatsheet, now also showing the condition for an orthogonally diagonalizable matrix.
